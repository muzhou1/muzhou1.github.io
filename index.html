<a><h2><b>Research overview</b></h2></a>
<p align="justify">
My current research is focused on medical imaging analysis and machine learning (deep learning) for accurate diagnosis, tailored planning of treatment, and precise prediction of outcomes. The findings provide rapid decision support for clinicians to improve diagnostic accuracy for patients at various stages. I also develop multi-scale biomedical data integration of medical imaging, genomics, and clinical records to advance our understanding of cancer risks. In particular, I study RNA-sequencing data analysis and apply bioinformatics approaches that lead to novel biomarkers with actionable insights for early lung cancer diagnosis and prognosis.
<br /><br />
Throughout my ongoing studies, I have broad research interests linking data science and clinical insights with emphasis on addressing two important questions: How do we integrate clinical information with multi-modality medical data (e.g., genomic and imaging) to expand the scope of precision medicine? How do machine learning techniques help build powerful clinical decision-support systems towards more informed decision making and shape the future of human health? Sections below highlight selected research projects.

<br />
<img src="figure/1Lung.png" itemprop="image" width="620" height="200" alt="teaserImage">
<p align="justify">
We develop deep-learning models for accurate lung nodule classifcation using thoracic CT imaging data. Unlike
traditional studies relying on hand-crafted feature extraction, we
design a Multi-scale Convolutional Neural Networks (MCNN) to extract
discriminative CNN-based features from alternatingly stacked layers. Our framework utilizes
multi-scale nodule patches to learn class-specific features simultaneously
by concatenating response neuron activations obtained at the
last layer from each input scale. We use the Lung Image Database Consortium and Image Database
Resource Initiative (LIDC-IDRI), where both lung nodule CT and
nodule annotations are provided by radiologists. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method on classifying malignant and benign nodules. We are constructing a large-scale radiological database with available clinical records for comprehensive evaluation of deep-learning models, thereby faciliating clinical desicion making for cancer diagnosis.

<a><h2><b>Imaging genomics</b></h2></a>
<br />
<img src="figure/demo_image_genomics.jpg" itemprop="image" width="420" height="200" align = "left">
<p align="justify">
Imaging genomics, also known as radiogenomics, is a growing field that studies the association between imaging biomarkers and genomic characteristics in cancer. Inherent in this definition is the goal to allow noninvasive imaging assessment as surrogates for molecular signatures that were only available through molecular testing. We develop a radiogenomic map linking CT image features and gene expression profiles generated by RNA sequencing for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We define CT semantic features reflecting radiologic information of nodule shape, margin, texture, and tumor enviroment and overall lung characteristics. In the meantime, total RNA was extracted from the tumor tissue with RNA sequencing techniques. Our analysis highlighted multiple associations between semantic image features and metagenes representing canonical molecular pathways and can result in non-invasive identification of molecular properties of NSCLC with prognostic implications.

<a><h2><b>Imaging Habitats in Glioblastoma</b></h2></a>
<br />
<img src="figure/Figure2_habitat.png" itemprop="image" width="700" height="320" >
<p align="justify">
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common malignant brain tumor in adults. Most GBMs exhibit extensive regional heterogeneity at tissue, cellular, and molecular scales, but the clinical relevance of the observed spatial imaging characteristics remains unknown. We investigate pre-treatment magnetic resonance image (MRI) scans of GBMs to identify tumor sub-regions (habitats) and quantify their image-based spatial characteristics that are associated with overall survival. The defined tumor sub-regions in GBMs as shown in the Figure above, which are hypothesized to evaluate intratumoral characteristics with multiparametric MRI sequences. For proof-of-concept, we developed a computational framework that used intratumoral grouping and spatial mapping to identify GBM tumor sub-regions and yield habitat-based features. We demonstrated that the quantitative spatial-correlated features derived from MRI-defined tumor sub-regions in GBM were predictive to survival of patients.
